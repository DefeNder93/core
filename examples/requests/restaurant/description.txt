There is a Japanese restaurant with plates that moving in a circle on a table near the visitors. A cook puts the plate on the table
 when it's ready. There are few types of plates and users can choose and take plate if they like it. If one visitor take a plate, next person can't take it.
 He have to wait for a new one. If plate make a circle and no one take it the cook give that plate to a cat.
